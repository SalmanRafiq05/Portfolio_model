            Although my original plan was to teach early primary, a Fourth Grade
            student teaching position in the Chicago Public School System
            changed my mind by allowing me to experience older students'
            curiosity and desire to learn. Since then, I've gain experience
            teaching Second, Third and Fourth Grades.

              real-world contexts. <br />

            <h3>Assessments</h3>
            <p>
              Apply varied assessment methods to measure the knowledge gained by
              students and to improve student learning. <br />
              Summative Assessment including use of pre and post tests to show
              growth and mastery of a concept. <br />
              Formative Assessment to assess the need for adjustment in
              instruction to increase student learning. Example: When results of
              an exit slip showed students did not grasp the desired concept,
              instructional plans were adjusted. Using a different approach
              allowed students to learn the material, ensuring the method of
              instruction wasn’t what made the topic difficult. <br />
              Informal Assessment – ongoing monitoring to evaluate student
              comprehension and modifying lesson plans as needed. Example: When
              a quick check on a whiteboard revealed students didn’t understand
              the lesson’s objective, instead of moving on I adjusted and
              revisited the topic through another method. <br />Student
              Formative Self-Assessment to allow students to reflect on their
              own understanding of the lesson’s learning goal. (Master's
              Action-Based Research Project). Example: Allowed students to think
              and write about their understanding of a math lesson, explain
              their strategies and reasoning to solve problems and their
              communication of a solution. Standardized or Norm Tests, such as
              MAP testing or STAR testing, that use data to determine what needs
              to be a focus for instructional material. Example: Using MAP data
              to identify areas of improvement for Math and ELA standards, I
              designed and implemented units to develop these skills. For
              example, a unit focused on text structure and genre improved
              students’ MAP scores, and use of a common formative assessment as
              a pre and post-test showed students had a greater understanding of
              structural elements of text genres. Example: Reviewed STAR math
              and reading scores to see areas of weakness and strength in these
              subjects, as well as to determine how to group students based on
              ability, and to adjust groups as student understanding changes.
              After administering STAR test multiple times throughout the year,
              data showed average student growth increased by a grade level.

              <h3>Differentiation and Diversity</h3>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Working in both public and private, and in urban and rural
                schools, I have gained experience in diverse classroom settings.</li>
                <li>When creating lessons, I take students’ cultures, backgrounds,
                levels of knowledge/skills, and learning styles into
                consideration and provide multiple means of access to materials.</li>
                <li>Coordinate classroom learning to achieve a balance between whole
                group instruction, small group collaboration and individual
                work.</li>
                 <li>
                  Use diverse methods of instruction to allow for auditory,
                kinesthetic and visual learners to be successful. Utilizing
                technology resources to enhance lessons.                 
                </li>
                <li>Example: Incorporated
                Seesaw activities that allow students to practice and show the
                mastery of a math skill by drawing, writing or audio recording
                their math thinking. Example: In a collaborative project,
                students wrote, typed and shared a reader’s theater script with
                a classroom in another state. This allowed students to use
                technology while also working on literacy standards.

            <h3>Life-long Learning</h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li> As a teacher I aim to encourage life-long learning in all my
              students. Exposing students to opportunities beyond the classroom
              is one way to foster a love of learning.</li>
              <li>Take advantage of the
              surrounding environment to provide meaningful field trips that
              relate the content to resources or the history of where I’m
              teaching. Relating the material to students’ lives.</li>
              <li>Example: In an
              effort to promote literacy, I implemented novels that related to
              4th graders. Interacting with the text by close reading and
              discussion with their classmates promoted a desire to read. Use
              personal experiences to teach students about the world beyond
              their community. Example: While teaching in a rural community, I
              shared stories of my urban life experiences (Chicago, Rome, Milan,
              Portland, OR) to broaden my students' view of the world beyond
              what they know.</li>

              grade students to the language and culture of another country with
              our Italian Word of the Day, and by taking them on a visual

              <h3>Collaboration and Communication</h3>
              <p>
               <ul class="sec">
                <li>Maintain regular communication with principal. An open
                relationship promotes opportunities for support in the various
                areas of teaching including curriculum, behavior issues,
                parental involvement and other concerns within the school.</li>
                <li> Strong communication with parents and guardians is essential.
                Contact parents/guardians when problems arise, but also when a
                student has done something successful in the classroom to help
                develop positive parent-teacher relationship.</li>
                <li> Collaboration with
                fellow teachers to share ideas or provide support. Example:
                While a recent position didn’t have other same-grade-level
                teachers, I held frequent discussions with teachers from
                lower/higher grades on how curriculum relates to previously
                learned content and the skills and concepts needed for future
                applications of topics.</li>
                <li>
                   Example: Worked with other
                same-grade-level teachers from other schools during Professional
                Development days to share and dissect best practices related to
                math standards.

          <h3>Classroom Management</h3>
          <P><ul>
            <li>I hold each student accountable for his/her learning to encourage him or her to succeed in the classroom.</li>
            <li>The classroom environment is one that fosters respect for all, responsibility for actions, and readiness to learn</li>
            <li> Descriptive classroom procedures direct students to the type of behavior they are expected to demonstrate. Continual practice and opportunities for leadership allow students to develop habits that promote learning.</li>
            <li> Students develop independent work habits as well as collaboration with peers, through varied classroom opportunities.</li>
            <li> I have a high expectation for all students, requiring them to put forth the effort and work that they are all capable of. When a student doesn’t reach this expectation on a particular assignment, I give them the chance to reflect on what they did and provide the opportunity to improve on their understanding.</li>
